Goroutines.

We all know and love goroutines.
They're a lightweight way to write concurrent code.

We should note, though,
that they're cheap, but they're not free.

Besides the runtime cost,
every goroutine costs *at least* 2 kilobytes of memory to start.
Starting Go 1.19, this can be higher -- based on your program's
average goroutine stack size.

I'll admit, these numbers aren't terrible.
What's 2 kilobytes among a couple gigabytes?
But fact is, these numbers add up --
especially in long-running production services.

So let's discuss how to tame your goroutines.

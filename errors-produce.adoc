Over here, when I talk about producing errors,
I'm specifically thinking of "leaf" errors.

This is made up terminology again,
and again, it's all made up,
so I'll stick with it.

Leaf errors are the root cause -- they do not wrap anything else.

---

Yeah, leaf errors are root.
My analogies are running out the garden here.

Let me demonstrate with an example.
--

[.columns]
== Leaf errors

[.column]
--
Not a leaf error

[source,go]
----
out, err := f()
if err != nil {
  return err
}

out, err := g()
if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf("g: %v", err)
}
----
--

[.column]
--
Leaf errors

[source,go]
----
return errors.New("great sadness")

return fmt.Errorf(
  "unhappy result %q", result)
----
--

[.notes]

Left side does not hold leaf errors.
I'm running an operation,
and if they fail, I'm passing that error upstream.
Not a leaf.

Right side holds leaf errors.
It creates errors from nothing.
It creates a problem for us to deal with
where there wasn't one before.

These are the ones I want to talk about right now.

[.columns]
== Can they be handled?

image::gopher-handles.png[background, size="100px 100px", position="bottom 10% left 10%"]

[.column.is-half]
--
[.medium]
No

[.small, step=1]
Use `fmt.Errorf` / `errors.New`

[.medium, step=1]
[source,go]
----
return errors.New("session is closed")

return fmt.Errorf(
  "invalid email address %q", email)
----
--

[.column.is-half]
--
[.medium]
Yes

[step=2]
* Sentinel errors
* Structured errors
--

[.notes]

With leaf errors, the first thing you want to think about is,
"can they be handled?"

Rather, do you want the caller to be able to react to this error.
React to it in a way besides just wrapping and returning it, that is.
Does the caller get information from knowing this error occurred,
that they would want to react to programmatically?

---

If the answer is no, just use vanilla `fmt.Errorf` and `errors.New`.
Don't make it complicated.

---

If the answer is yes, you have two options:
sentinel errors and structured errors.
Each satisfies a different need.

Let's talk about sentinel errors first.

= Producing errors

When I'm talking about producing errors,
I'm specifically talking about "leaf" errors.

This is made up terminology, but to be fair, all terminology is made up.
So I'll stick with it.

Leaf errors are the root cause -- they do not wrap anything else.
Yeah, leaf errors are the root.
I know, my analogies are running out the garden.

[.columns]
== Leaf errors

[.column]
--
Not a leaf error

[source,go]
----
out, err := f()
if err != nil {
  return err
}

out, err := g()
if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf("g: %v", err)
}
----
--

[.column]
--
Leaf errors

[source,go]
----
return errors.New("great sadness")

return fmt.Errorf(
  "unhappy result %q", result)
----
--

[.notes]

Just as examples,
left returns the error, possibly wrapping it,
right *creates* a new error out of nowhere.

These are the ones I want to talk about right now.

[.columns]
== Can they be handled?

[.column.is-half]
--
[.medium]
No

[.small, step=1]
Use `fmt.Errorf` / `errors.New`

[.medium, step=1]
[source,go]
----
return errors.New("session is closed")

return fmt.Errorf(
  "invalid email address %q", email)
----
--

[.column.is-half]
--
[.medium]
Yes

[step=2]
* Sentinel errors
* Structured errors

With leaf errors, your first consideration is,
"can they be handled?"

Or rather, do you want a caller to be able to react to this error
besides just returning it or logging it.

If the answer is no, just use vanilla fmt.Errorf or errors.New.
Don't make it complicated.

If the answer is yes, you have two options.
Sentinel errors and structured errors -- depending on your needs.

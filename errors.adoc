Okay, let's talk about errors.
There are two dimensions to talk about errors:
Producing errors and consuming them.

Let's talk about producing them first first.

== Summary

* Use sentinel and structured errors when needed
* `fmt.Errorf` and `errors.New` otherwise
* Match with `errors.Is` and `errors.As` to handle

So in short,

* Use sentinel and structured errors when you need your leaf errors,
  or in the case of structured errors, also your wrapper errors,
  to be matchable with `errors.Is` and `errors.As`.
* Use `fmt.Errorf` and `errors.New` for most other cases.
* Match errors with `errors.Is` and `errors.As` and then handle them.

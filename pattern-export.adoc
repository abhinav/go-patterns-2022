* Be deliberate

Exported means forever.

There's not much you can do about this
since you can't go back once published.

So just be careful:

* Be deliberate in your choice of what you export.
  Just because it *might* be useful does not mean it should be exported.
* You can always export it later -- when you need it --
  so wait until you need it.

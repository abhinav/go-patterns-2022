We'll talk about a couple things today.

* First, we'll discuss some rules we're operating under
  for writing good, maintainable packages and libraries.
* We'll talk about why those rules make sense.
* After that, we'll discuss some patterns we can use to operate
  within those rules.
* Last, we'll discuss some general best practices.

Okay, let's get started.

The agenda for this talk is roughly this,

* First, we'll discuss some rules we're operating under
  for good, maintainable packages and libraries,
  and why those rules make sense.
* Next, we'll talk about some patterns we can use to operate
  inside these rules, and how to use them.

Okay, let's get started.

[.notes]

As the name suggested, structured errors on the other hand,
are just types that implement the error interface,
that users can extract information from.

Use these when there's information to expose.
The line number at which the error occurred,
the name of the object that's already using a resource you wanted to use,
etc.

If you use these,

* name them by adding a "Error" suffix.
  This is distinct from the "Err" prefix on variables.
* *Always* use a pointer receiver. This is necessary to make these comparable.
* Users will be able to match these with `errors.As`.

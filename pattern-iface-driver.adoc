= Driver Interface

[.notes]

Okay, so I don't know if there's a real name for this pattern.
I'm just making the name up.

Let me first explain the pattern at a high level,
and then I'll demonstrate with code.

[mermaid,data-id=img]
....

  subgraph Driver
    WriteBytes
  end

In this pattern, you start with a "Driver" interface
with the most minimal API.

[%auto-animate%conceal]
== Driver interface diagram

[mermaid,data-id=img]
....
flowchart LR
  subgraph Writer
    WriteBytesOut[WriteBytes]
  end

  subgraph Driver
    WriteBytes
  end

  WriteBytesOut --> WriteBytes
....

[.notes]
--
You build a struct around it, say, Writer,
that provides roughly the same API.

But then on top of that, you can add other functionality
that depends on the small interface.

[%auto-animate%conceal]
== Driver interface diagram

[mermaid,data-id=img]
....
flowchart LR
  subgraph Writer
    WriteBytesOut[WriteBytes]
    WriteString
  end

  subgraph Driver
    WriteBytes
  end

  WriteBytesOut & WriteString --> WriteBytes
....

This is similar to exporting a top-level function,
except it still provides all methods on the same object.

Let me demonstrate with code quickly.

[%auto-animate%auto-animate-restart%conceal]
== Driver interface intro

[source,go]
----
type Driver interface {
  WriteBytes([]byte) error
}
----

[source%linenums,go,data-id=writer]
----
type Writer struct{ drv Driver }

func (w *Writer) WriteBytes(bs []byte) error {
  return w.drv.WriteBytes(bs)
}
----

[.notes]
--
I start with a Writer struct that has the same interface
as the driver.
--

[%auto-animate%conceal]
== Driver interface intro

[source%linenums,go,data-id=writer]
----
type Writer struct{ drv Driver }

func (w *Writer) WriteBytes(bs []byte) error {
  return w.drv.WriteBytes(bs)
}

func (w *Writer) WriteString(bs []byte) error {
  return w.WriteBytes([]string(bs))
}
----

[.notes]
--
And then I do the same thing I did with the
top-level WriteString function earlier,
but as a method.

I can support upcasting on this interface too!

[%auto-animate%conceal]
== Driver interface intro

[source%linenums,go,data-id=writer]
----
type Writer struct{ drv Driver }

func (w *Writer) WriteBytes(bs []byte) error {
  return w.drv.WriteBytes(bs)
}

type StringWriter interface {
  WriteString(string) error
}

func (w *Writer) WriteString(bs []byte) error {
  if sw, ok := w.(StringWriter); ok {
    return sw.WriteString(s)
  }
  return w.WriteBytes([]string(bs))
}

So I'm sort of able to give my users the best of both worlds.

== Driver interface benefits

*Benefits*

* Implement a small interface
* Consume a large surface

[.notes]
--
Users that want to implement the interface
only have to implement as little of it as they need.

Users that want to *consume* the functionality provided by it,
can consume the struct and get a much richer API.

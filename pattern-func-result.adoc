`struct` *exclusively* for returns except error

New fields for new outputs

Need more than 2 results? +
Use a `struct`.

[.notes]

Result objects are the analog of parameter objects
for returning values.
They're equally simple.
A struct that exists solely to hold values returned by a function.
All except the `error`, which should remain the last output of your function.

You can add new fields to this struct -- new things your function needs to
return,
and that's completely backwards compatible.

Similar rule of thumb applies here.
Need to produce more than two things?
Return a struct.

Do not fire-and-forget

Well, there's sort of only one rule disguised as two.

Every goroutine must finish --
it must have a known, predictable time at which it will stop running,
and you must have the ability to wait for this time to pass.

If that is not true for a goroutine,
you must have the ability to tell the goroutine to stop,
and have the ability to wait for it to stop running after you tell it to stop.

---

In short, do not fire and forget.

I should never import a package and find out
that it started a background goroutine in a `func init()`
that I have no way of stopping or controlling.

Okay, let's look at some code.

Stop with `close(stop)`
--

[.notes]

This is a simple worker goroutine.
It runs forever, and periodically flushes something somewhere.
It cannot be stopped.
This is bad.

This needs to be stoppable.
Let's make it that.

---

I'm making use of two new things here:

* I switched the `time.Sleep`-in-a-loop to a `time.Ticker`.
  It's about the same in that it'll "tick" at the same frequency,
  but it gives me the ticks in a channel instead of just blocking my goroutine.
  This lets me `select` on it.
* Which brings me to the second piece.
  I've introduced an empty channel named `stop`.
  My goroutine selects between this and the ticker.
  The `case` for the `stop` channel will resolve when I close the channel,
  which tells the goroutine it's time to exit.

Note that I defer a `tick.Stop` -- when the goroutine exits,
it'll also stop the ticker.
Otherwise it would keep trying to send ticks to the channel.

This is good.
But it can be better.

Stop with `cancel()`
--

[.notes]
--
The only change I've made here is,
instead of a hand-managed `stop` channel,
I'm relying on `context.Context`.

I build a context --
whether with `context.WithCancel` or with `context.WithTimeout` --
and get back a context and a cancel function.
The context has a "done" channel that is accessible with the Done method.
The "done" channel resolves when the context has finished.
The context is considered to have finished when someone calls cancel,
or if it had a timeout, when the timeout passes -- whichever comes first.

So our goroutine now selects between the context's Done channel and the ticker.

Why is this better?
Because it gives us a context scoped to the lifetime of this goroutine.
I can pass that context down to `flush`,
which can then pass it down to any other function it calls.
Any work those functions do,
they can try to scope it to the context's lifetime.
If the context has expired,
it means that the caller doesn't care about the result anymore,
so they don't need to do the work that's going to be thrown away anyway.

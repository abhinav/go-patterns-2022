In conclusion:

* Don't export something until it's necessary
* When you do export it, plan for expansion:
** use parameter objects, result objects, functional options, upcasting, driver
   interfaces, everything else to make sure you don't break your exported
   functions or interfaces.
* Don't leak goroutines -- control their lifetime
* Don't write redundant error messages
* Do expose errors that should be handled, and handle them properly

First, let's establish some rules for writing code.
These rules motivate the designs we'll discuss later.

These rules mostly apply to libraries,
but you can apply them to any Go package
to build higher quality shareable packages.

My team aims to meet these constraints in most of our code.
If it's not part of core application logic, treat it like a library,
and the overall application will tend towards higher quality.

The rules are:

* Exported means forever
* Function types are fixed
* Interfaces are immutable

Let me quickly elaborate a bit on each.

So to summarize, here are the rules again.

* Don't take away something once given
* Don't change function signatures
* Don't change *anything* about interfaces

Okay, so we have some rules.
How do we build around them?
What patterns can we use to make sure we don't break them?
